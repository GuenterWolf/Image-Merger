# Image Merger
This program merges two images into three other images in such a way that the two images are almost invisible in the resulting three images.

When the three result images are placed on top of each other in the correct orientation, the hidden two images are revealed.

The surprise of the audience watching the show is guaranteed ;-)

This utility was inspired by the brilliant artwork of [Petros Vrellis](http://artof01.com/vrellis/works/AllAndOne.html "Out of All Things One, and Out of One All Things").
